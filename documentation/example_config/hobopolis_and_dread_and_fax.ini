                Sewer = Each player needs 100 sewer points. Opened valves/grates, Hobo codes, and various sewer items make progress easier. Only one player can be in the cage. Use -combat modifiers.
                Town = Overkill hobos to make scarehobo parts (but no nickels!). Up to 6 players can get on stage with an instrument; another player can mosh or busk to kill hobos or get nickels.
                Burnbarrel = Tirevalanches kill hobos. The higher the stack of tires, the more hobos killed, but the rarer the Getting Tired adventure becomes.
                bb = Tirevalanches kill hobos. The higher the stack of tires, the more hobos killed, but the rarer the Getting Tired adventure becomes.
                exposure = Pipes can open the club in the PLD or make icicles. Yodels kill hobos based the number of icicles. Hobo ability: cold damage when you hurt them.
                ee = Pipes can open the club in the PLD or make icicles. Yodels kill hobos based the number of icicles. Hobo ability: cold damage when you hurt them.
                heap = Causing trashcanos raises the stench level to open the special I Refuse! adventure (see !rule I Refuse). Hobo ability: damage every round based on stench level.
                ahbg = Study dancing 3 times, then dance to kill hobos. Dances get less effective after the 17th. Total dances are limited to (PLD flim-flams) * 5. Hobo ability: elemental resistance.
                burial = Study dancing 3 times, then dance to kill hobos. Dances get less effective after the 17th. Total dances are limited to (PLD flim-flams) * 5. Hobo ability: elemental resistance.
                pld = Use +combat. Flim-flamming helps open club and increases AHBG dances available. Inside the club, barfights kill hobos; nosepicks give you stats but decrease unpopularity.
                purple = Club opens at 21 unpopularity. Flim-flamming increases unpopularity and AHBG dances available. In the club, barfights kill hobos; nosepicks give you stats but decrease unpopularity.
                scratch = """If you have more than 5 effects, Ol' Scratch will debuff you. He also does 40-60 hot damage every round in addition to normal attacks."""
                frosty = Frosty can only be killed with multiple sources of damage (including prismatic and passive damage), since he takes 3 damage from hot/spooky sources and 1 from other sources.
                oscus = Oscus has a stench-based gas attack that doubles in strength every combat round.
                zombo = Zombo takes only 1 damage from elemental sources, and unequips your pants, hat, and shirt in the first three combat rounds.
                chester = Chester prevents the use of items in combat.
                hodgman = Hodgman has a lot of HP and resists damage. Any unkilled Hobopolis bosses will give Hodgman an extra ability.
