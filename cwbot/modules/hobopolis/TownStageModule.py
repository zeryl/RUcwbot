    A module that keeps track of the stage in town square, including getting
    on/off stage, mosh damage, and busking .Players do not directly communicate
    with this module; instead, the TownModule passes events to get information
    from this module. However, the module does send chats when stage
    events occur.
    
    The module has three modes: KNOWN, GUESSED, and UNKNOWN. The module starts
    in KNOWN mode. In this mode, it can accurately track how many people are
    on stage and how much damage is done in moshes. 
    
    If the bot starts up and there's been a mosh/busk/show ruin since it
    last was online, it changes to UNKNOWN mode. Here it doesn't know if
    anyone is on stage. For now, this happens even if there haven't been
    100 hobos killed.
    
    The next time the stage is cleared, it reverts to GUESSED mode. At this
    time, it calculates the minimum amount of damage that could have happened
    due to moshing while it was offline, and adds that to the total killed.
    It's a crude approximation, but in normal operation the bot should not
    be offline to miss much stage activity.
    
    
    NOTE: This module must be loaded **before** the TownModule; it is a
    dependency. 
    
    No configuration options.
