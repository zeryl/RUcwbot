    """ 
    A module that tracks the tire stack in Burnbarrel Blvd.
    This module is extremely complicated due to the stateful nature of
    Burnbarrel Blvd. Basically, there are 3 modes of operation:
    
    In KNOWN mode, the bot has been online to witness every tirevalanche.
    This means the bot can calculate how many tires were stacked for each
    one. Note that if the bot goes offline, it can still figure out how many
    tires it missed if there hasn't been a new tirevalanche by comparing the
    total number of tires when it logged off to the total number when it
    logged on. If the bot is in KNOWN mode, it can figure out exactly how many
    hoboes have been killed due to tirevalanches.
    
    If the bot misses a tirevalanche, then there's a 
    problem. How many of the missed tires were thrown on the stack before
    the tirevalanche, and how many after? There's no way to know. If the bot
    starts up and missed these events, it switches to UNKNOWN mode. It will
    now need to guess how many hoboes were killed in the previous
    tirevalanches. It does this by splitting the missed tires evenly among all
    of the tirevalanches it missed. This results in the lowest possible
    estimate of hoboes killed.
    
    The next time a tirevalanche occurs, it commits its estimate and upgrades
    itself to GUESSED mode. The bot assumes that its estimate is correct. The
    only difference between GUESSED and KNOWN is that it displays a > symbol
    in its tag to indicate a guessed value.  
    
    No configuration options.
